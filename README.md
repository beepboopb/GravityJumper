## Project Description
The project structure is based on the design pattern [model-view-controller].

### Model

The Model contains all the logic of the game.

### View

The View gets all objects to render from the model trough an interface.
To render the view we used the C# Framework [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/).

### Controller

The controller handles the input and sets the states of the player.
